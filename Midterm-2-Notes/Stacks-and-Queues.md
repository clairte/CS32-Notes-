# Stacks and Queues 
## Introduction 

- Stacks and queues are higher level data structures 

    - You can implement a stack as an array or as a linked-list 

    - Not as fundamental 

        - You can't implement a linked list as an array, or implement an array as a linked list

## Stack 

- Sequence of items: LIFO
    
    - The only place to insert an item is from one end

    - The only place to remove an item is from the same end 

### Stack operations 

1. Create an empty stack `stack<classType> name` 

2. Push an item onto the stack (add) `name.push(element)`

    - Possibilites of failure
        - If fixed-size: what if we run out of room -> could fail 
        - If resizable: that's fine

3. Pop an item from the stack (remove) `name.pop()`

    - Possibilities of failure 
        - What if the stack is empty?

4. Look at the top item on the stack (top of stack is the active end of stack)

    - `name.top()` returns the top element 

    - Possibilities of failure 
        - What if the stack is empty?

5. Is the stack empty? `name.empty()`

> Optional items: 

6. Look at any item in the stack  `name.size()` 

7. How many items are in the stack 

### Stack in C++ Library 

```
#include <stack>
using namespace std; 

//Create an empty stack 
stack<int> s; //in <>: the type of data you want in a stack 

//Add items 
s.push(10); 
s.push(20); 

//Visualization of stack 
s: ===> 
10 20 

//Check top of stack 
cout << s.top() << endl; //20 

//Remove item 
s.pop(); 

//Visualization 
s: ===> 
10 

if (s.empty())
{
    cout << "Stack is empty!" << endl; 
}
else
{
    cout << s.top() << endl; //writes 10 
}

//How many items 
cout << s.size() << endl; 
```
- There is no member function to check any item of the stack in C++ library 

- `s.pop()`: returns `void`, removes the top value 

    - in other languages: pop may remove and return the value 

        ``` 
        S.PUSH(30); 
        int n = s.POP(); //n is 30, 30 was removed from the stack 
        ```
    
    - in C++

        ```
        s.push(30); 
        int n = s.top(); 
        s.pop(); 
        ```

    - what if we call this when the stack is empty? 

        - C++ throws an exception, undefined behavior 

            - due to performance issues 

- `s.push()` method 

    - Would we run out of room? 

        - In C++: the size can grow, but we can run out of memory 

### Scenario: Expression evaluation 

- Prefix notation: 

    - The operation comes before the operand: `f(x, y, z)` 

        - The operation is `f`, the operands are `x`, `y`, `z` 

    - Mathematical operations in prefix notation

        - `add(sub(8, div(6,2)), 1)`

        - `+ - 8 / 6 2 1`ï¼š there is a unique way to interpret this expression 

            - Infix notation: 8-6/2+1

                - infix notation requires more rules of precedence,associativity rules, etc. 

- Postfix notation: 

    - The operation comes after the operand

        `8 6 2 / - 1 +`

    - Like prefix notation, its unambiguous 

- Program that can evaluate infix notation for mathematical operation

    - Algorithm: 

        - Go through infix string, convert sequence into postfix string 

        - Given postfix string, visit each item, evaluate the answer 
    
    - If infix to prefix, just reverse the string and do infix to postfix 

    - Infix to postfix: Use **operator stack**

        - Tricky: Associativity and precedence 

        - If the current item is an operand, append it to the result sequence

        - If the current item is (, push it onto the stack: 

            - the open parentheses is pushed onto the stack as a marker to tell the algorithm when to stop popping when it reaches a closed )

        - If the current item is )
            
            - pop operators off the stack, appending them to the result sequence, until you pop an (, which you do not append to the sequence

        - If the current item is an operator: 

            - If the operator stack is empty, push the current operator onto the stack 

            - If the stack is not empty:

                - If the top of the stack is `(`, push the operator onto stack 

                - If the current operator has precedence greater than that of the operator at the top of the stack: push current operator onto the stack 

                - Otherwise: 
                
                    - pop the top operator onto stack and append it to the result sequence

                    - check again (loop)
        
        - At the end of the input sequence, pop each operator off the stack and append it to the result sequence 
        
        ```
        //if operand, append to result 
        8 - 6 / 2 + 1
        ^ 
        Operator stack: =====> 

        result: 8 

        //Operator, empty stack, push onto stack 
        8 - 6 / 2 + 1
          ^ 
        Operator stack: =====> 
        -
        result: 8 

        //operand, append to result
        8 - 6 / 2 + 1
            ^ 
        Operator stack: =====> 
        -
        result: 8 6 

        //Operator precedence >= stack operator, push onto stack 
        8 - 6 / 2 + 1
              ^ 
        Operator stack: =====> 
        - / 
        result: 8 6 

        //operand, append to result 
        8 - 6 / 2 + 1
                ^ 
        Operator stack: =====> 
        - / 
        result: 8 6 2

        //Operator precedence <= stack operator, pop operator off stack
        8 - 6 / 2 + 1
                  ^ 
        Operator stack: =====> 
        - 
        result: 8 6 2 / 

        //Check again, precedence <= operator on top of stack, pop 
        8 - 6 / 2 + 1
                  ^ 
        Operator stack: =====> 
        
        result: 8 6 2 / - 

        //Check again, now stack empty, push operator onto stack 
        8 - 6 / 2 + 1
                  ^ 
        Operator stack: =====> 
        +
        result: 8 6 2 / - 

        //operand, append to result 
        8 - 6 / 2 + 1
                    ^ 
        Operator stack: =====> 
        +
        result: 8 6 2 / - 1 

        //Reached the end of a string
        8 - 6 / 2 + 1
                     ^ 
        Operator stack: =====> 
        +
        result: 8 6 2 / - 1 +
        ```

    - Evalute postfix expression: **Use operand stack**

        ` 8 6 2 / - 1 +`

        - Push operands onto stack 

        - When see operator, pop two items off the stack and apply operation

        - Push result onto the stack 

        ```
        8 6 2 / - 1 +
        ^
        Operand stack: =====> 
        8

        8 6 2 / - 1 +
          ^
        Operand stack: =====> 
        8 6 

        8 6 2 / - 1 +
            ^
        Operand stack: =====> 
        8 6 2

        //Operator '/' pop two items off
        8 6 2 / - 1 +
              ^
        Operand stack: =====> 
        8                                     6  /  2

        //Push back result onto stack 
        8 6 2 / - 1 +
              ^
        Operand stack: =====> 
        8  3

        8 6 2 / - 1 +
                ^
        Operand stack: =====> 
                                              8  -  3

        8 6 2 / - 1 +
                  ^
        Operand stack: =====> 
        5 

        8 6 2 / - 1 +
                  ^
        Operand stack: =====> 
        5 1

        8 6 2 / - 1 +
                    ^
        Operand stack: =====> 
                                             5   +  1
        
        8 6 2 / - 1 +
                    ^
        Operand stack: =====> 
        6 

        //End of string: result = 6 
        ```

        - If the postfix string was properly formed, the result will always have one number on the stack 

        - Some complications: 

            - Three operands: different operator symbol for it, just push three onto stack 

            - One operator that means different things based on number of operands e.g. `-5` versus `8-5` 

                - when converting from infix to postfix, change these into different symbols 
    
    - What about parentheses? 

        `2 * (8 - (4 - 2) * 3) / 2`

        - Turn expression into equivalent postfix 

            ``` 
            //operand, append to result
            2 * (8 - (4 - 2) * 3) / 2
            ^
            operator stack:  ====> 

            result: 2

            //operator, empty stack, push onto stack 
            2 * (8 - (4 - 2) * 3) / 2
              ^

## Queue 

- Sequence of items: FIFO

- Stack v. Queue:

    - One active end v. Two active ends 

### Queue operations 

1. Create an empty queue `queue<classType> name` 

2. Enqueue an item (add a new item) `name.push(element)`

3. Dequeue an item (remove from other end) `name.pop()`

4. Look at the front item `name.front()` 

    - We don't tend to need to look at the back of the queue, guy just waits 

    - You can't look at the front of the queue if it has no items 

    - returns a reference to the front most element 

5. Is the queue empty `name.empty()` 

> Optional operations: 

6. Look at the back item in the queue `name.back()` 

7. Look at any item in the queue 

8. How many items are in the queue `name.size()`

### Queue in C++ 

```
#include <queue> 

using namespace std; 

//Create 
queue<int> q; 

//Enqueue 
q.push(10); 
q.push(20); 

//Visualization 
q: x --> x x x x x --> x 
        20    10

//Look at front of queue 
cout << q.front() << endl; //10 

//Dequeue 
q.pop(); 

//Visualization
q: x --> x x x x x --> x 
            20    

//Check if queue empty 
if (q.empty())
{
    cout << "Queue is empty!" << endl; 
}
else 
{
    cout << q.front() << endl; //writes 20 
}

//Check size
cout << q.size() << endl; //writes 1 

//Can look at the back of the queue
cout << q.size() << endl; //writes 20
``` 

- You can't look at any item in the queue 

- `q.pop()` returns void (just as in stack)

- If you try to ask about or remove front/back of empty queue -> undefined behavior 

--- 
## Implementation of Stack and Queue 

### Implement a stack as an array 
- If I have an array with elements 

- To push an item, just insert at the end

- To pop an item, just remove at the end 

- Everything is efficient as long as we know where the top of the stack it 

    - We need an integer subscript or pointer to keep track 

    - `top` indicate *just past the last item* instead of last item itself 

        - Scenario: 

            - Underlying integer array of one item in the stack 

            - `top` would take integer subscript `0` (since item at index 0) and we only have 1 item 

            - When we pop the top --> `top` would be `-1`

            - HOWEVER: if use pointer representation 

                - `top` points to index 0

                - if we pop, we subtract 1 from the pointer -> undefined behavior to have a pointer to element negative 1 
        
        - `top` is also going to be the size of the stack 

    - To push an item: 

        - `top` tells me where to store the new item 

        - increment `top` 

        - trying to push to a full capacity

            - if `top` is index just past array -> fail 

            - resizable array: `top` just past array tells you to allocate a bigger array and delete the old array 

    - To pop an item: 

        - subtract 1 from `top`

        - we really don't do anything to the popped item, since we don't care, the limits have changed 

        - popping from an empty stack

            - `top` is `0` tells you the stack is empty 

            - if try to look at top of the stack (`top` index - 1) that is undefined behavior

            - if pop from stack, `top` will become `-1` 

                - then if we try checking we will be looking into `-2` 

                - then if we try pushing we will be pushing to `-1`, `top` will end up at 0 again 

### Implement a stack using a linked list 

- Head pointer points to the front, item points to the next

- This is BAD! 

    - Everytime I want to push I have to traverse the list 

    - What if we have tail pointer? --> now we can push easily 

    - But what if we want to pop? --> to go backwards we have to do a doubly-linked list 

- Rethink this: the 'end' of the stack be the end the head pointer points to 

    - Push: 

        - Allocate a new node 

        - Copy the head in there, make head point to first node 

        - Push one more: allocate one node, set value, copy pointer to next pointer, make head point to new node

        -Typically call the head point `top` 

    - Pop: 

        - Save a copy of the top pointer 

        - Change top to point to second item 

        - If try to pop from empty stack --> following nullptr --> crash 

### Implement a Queue Using An Array 

- Enqueue 
    
    - 10 at index 0, 20 at index 1, etc. 

- Dequeue 

    - Get rid of something 

- Need to keep track of where the first and last item is: two pointers 

    - Point to head: front 

        - Dequeue, remove item, advance head pointer 

    - Tail pointer point to end, for enqueue 

- If fixed sized array

    - Enqueue and dequeue process will lead to an array like this: 

        ``` 
        [] [] [] [] [] []... [23] [87] 
                              ^    ^
                              h    t
        ```
    - When we reach the end, do we want to allocate more memory? NO 

        - Queue has only two items, but array capacity is a 100, 98 empty spots 

            - If `t` is pointing to very last item, then copy all items to the beginning of the array 

    - Solution 1: 

        - Copy items back to the beginning 

            ```
            [23][87]...[][][]
            ```
        - Allocate more memory only when truly full 

        - **Disadvantages**: costly 

            - 98 elements in array, reached the end -> our algorithm tells us to move copy 98 elements to beginning to give 2 more empty spots 

            - Expensive copy 

            - A very short time later, we hit the end AGAIN -> have to shift again 

    - Solution 2: Wrap around back to the beginning 

        - Pretend that the next item after index 99 is 0 

            ```
            [87][][][][][][][21]
            ^                ^
            t                h
            ```

        - If at last item, then reset to beginning 

        - Allocate more memory if truly full 

        - Treat linear memory as if it were stored in a circle 

            - Ring buffer, 'circular array' 

        - We have two pointers, tail pointer points just *past* the last 

        ```
        [8][3][][][][][]
        ^     ^ 
        h     t
        ```
            
        - When we dequeue: 

            - when queue empty -> head pointer equal to the tail pointer

            - but NOT the other way around 

                - When the queue has 99 items in it, add one more tail pointer advances to the head pointer -> the queue is FULL 

                    ```
                    [6][7][][8][9]
                           ^ ^
                           t h 
                    ```

            - hence have to keep track of the size `size` variable

        - Growing the array: 

            - Copy, start at head, copy into index 0 of new array, go until 99, etc. 

                - Copy the element the `head` pointer is pointing to into index 0, NOT actually index 0 

### C++ Library Implementation of Stack and Queue  
- As long as popping and pushing are cheap -> use that
